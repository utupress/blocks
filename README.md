     <body>
         <!-- Insert HTML for contents. -->
     </body>
   </html>    
   ```

3. **Add design blocks.** Once you have the Utupress Design Blocks basic HTML structure in place, start browsing the design blocks that you want to use and copy/paste the HTML for them.



## What's included

Within the download archive you'll find the following directories and files, logically grouping common assets and providing both compiled and minified variations. You'll see something like this:

```
design-blocks/
├── dist/
│   ├── css/
│   │   ├── utupress_blocks.css
│   │   └── utupress_blocks.min.css
│   └── imgs/

```

We provide compiled CSS (`utupress_blocks.css`), as well as compiled and minified CSS (`utupress_blocks.min.css`). Also, in the downloaded archive you will find useful images and PSD files that you can use to create new backgrounds. In the `screenshots` folder, there are the screenshots of all design blocks.



## Dependencies

- **Bootstrap**. Utupress Design Blocks is built on Bootstrap 4 library and fully supports it. It uses the Javascript files only for the header design blocks, so if you don't need them, we recommend not to include the Bootstrap JS files in order to reduce your bundle size.

- **Font Awesome**. We're using the amazing Font Awesome library for the social network icons.

- **Google Fonts**. By default, the Design Blocks toolkit is built using the Roboto font, however that can easily be changed to other fonts.


## Browser Support

At the moment, we aim to support all major web browsers. Any issue in the browsers listed below should be reported as a bug:

- Internet Explorer 10+
- Microsoft Edge 14+
- Safari 6+
- Firefox (Current - 1) and Current versions
- Chrome (Current - 1) and Current versions
- Opera (Current - 1) and Current versions
- Safari iOS 7.0+
- Android 6.0+

(Current - 1) and Current means that we support the current stable version of the browser and the version that precedes it.
